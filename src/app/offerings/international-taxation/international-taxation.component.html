            <p style="text-align: justify;">The interplay of domestic and international taxes incident
                on companies often results in complex situations. Converging on an optimum solution requires taking
                a view on the “total” tax impact rather than a country-specific examination. The expertise of the

                countries has been useful to Indian and Foreign nationals and corporations having business in India
